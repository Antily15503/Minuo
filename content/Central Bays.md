The **Constitutional Union of the Central Bays** ([[Baylic]]: Cozantitucalion valo un Centralia Bayes), often known as the "Kingdom of the Central Bays", "Bayfolk Kingdom", or simply "Central Bays" is the Kingdom that spans most of the [[Baylands]]. It is often considered the remaining kingdom of the once powerful [[Empire of Kaision]], and as such, is sometimes called Kaision, or "Kaision Kingdom". The country's 21 independent provinces ([[Baylic]]: provincae) is home to around 93 million citizens, all jointly ruled under King **Flervion IV of Antimonius**, as well as the Chamber of the Sentae  

The Bayfolk Kingdom's capital and largest city is **[[Thessanoi]]**, located and spans a large region of the [[Isioni Dalmania Province]]. It's main financial center is [[Aqualamino]], located in the [[Aquamentian Province]]. 

The [[Central Bays|Kingdom of the Central Bays]] nowadays is probably most well known for their legacy as descendants from the once powerful [[Empire of Kaision]]. The Kaision empire, under the ruling house Avarnos, ruled most of the [[Baylands]], [[Lesia]] and the [[Calzarnia Coast]] to the west, as well as [[Azland]] and the [[Canti Sinai]] to the east. However, decades of corruption and revolts in the far reaching realms of the empire eventually caused several fatal coups, bringing forth the [[Collapse of the Kaision Empire|collapse of the Empire]]. Since then, the [[Central Bays|Kingdom of the Central Bays]] prides itself in its strong economic rebound and military strength, following the industrial miracle that brought the weakened nation into a global superpower once more. 

Politics and Military aside, however, the Kingdom also prides itself in its rich cultural and archaeological history. From the [[Ruins of Haspiciopolis]] to the [[Ruined Temple of the Sun]], the Kingdom is famous for its strict laws surrounding historical buildings, and the quality of care it spends to maintain archaeological ruins.
