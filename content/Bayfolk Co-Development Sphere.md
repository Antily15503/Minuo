The **Bayfolk Co-Development Sphere**, or Bay-Co, for short, is an international organization organized by the [[Central Bays|Kingdom of the Central Bays]] as a joint security and economic alliance between member states. Officially declared in **1892** with the signing of the [[Aguamenti Accords]], Bay-Co was initially conceived as an economic alliance between member states, with member states adopting financial and trade standards moderated by the [[Central Bays]]. 

In light of the recent rise in Socialist and Societalist influences, Bay-Co, as since slowly expanded within all membering states, adding a new joint-military organization, as well as a collaborative intelligence and surveillance operation wing. As of **1924**, Bay-Co currently has 5 main operational branches, each directing one of the 5 fields of collaboration between all member states of Bay-Co.

##### **Economics**
Since inception, Bay-Co has always placed the economy of all member nations in top priority. Since the signing of the [[Azure Accords]], Bay-Co, with influence from the [[Central Bays|Kingdom of the Central Bays]], has always monitored the health and resilience of all member state economies through the Development of Co-Prosperity office within Bay-Co. Although most of the funding for the Development of Co-Prosperity comes from the [[Central Bays]], these funding has mostly been repurposed to develop and invest into the economies of other member states, namely [[Ealsridge]], [[Versín]], and [[Hespion]]. 

In return, the Development of Co-Prosperity requires member states to peg their currency standards onto the Bayfolkian Kinar (Kr), which was in turn pegged to the value of Gold.
