They **Holy Province of Versín**, (also known as the "Kingdom of Versín", or simply Versín), is the de-facto nation that controls the stretch of land between the two largest cities in the Versín Lowlands. It is often considered a theological duchy, with the control over the province resting largely within the hands of the Clergy. Versín is also famous for it's position as a Holy Province, with it's clerical capital of [[St. Morgansprine]] declared as a Holy Site for believers of the[[Corst Sect | Pure Corst]]. Versín's other major city, [[Altanísland]], situated along the [[Azidic Sea]] coast, is the largest city in the holy province, and also serves as the economic and political center of the province.

The [[Versín|Holy Province of Versín]] also contains many religious and cultural sites, such as the Shrine Upon the Hill, Great Library of the Forests, Carmello Chapel, and the Ruins of Abernad. Most of the chapels and many churches scattered across the Holy Province also features old artworks and tapestries, most of them painting the glory and sects of [[Pure Corst]].

## Name
It is uncertain where the name "Versín" first came from, though it is commonly thought to have been descended from the Verhunii tribes that first settled the region back in the early ages. Since then, many empires and conquerors have subjugated the region. These empires have all renamed this region of land to fit their language, though kept the sounds of the region constant throughout conquests.

Versín, when it was conquered by the growing [[Empire of Kaision]], was renamed to Verision Province. However, after the independence of the Versini people, the nation reverted to it's old name of "Versín" to preserve the identity of the Versini people.
