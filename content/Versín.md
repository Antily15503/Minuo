They **Holy Province of Versín**, (also known as the "Kingdom of Versín", or simply Versín), is the de-facto nation that controls the stretch of land between the two largest cities in the Versín Lowlands. It is often considered a theological duchy, with the control over the province resting largely within the hands of the Clergy. Versín is also famous for it's position as a Holy Province, with it's clerical capital of [[St. Morgansprine]] declared as a Holy Site for believers of the[[Corst Sect | Pure Corst]].
