All alliances in Minuo are born from similar interests. Whether those overlapping interests are small or large, any reason that allows a nation to work positively with three or more other nations often result in an alliance. Ever since the concept of a "nation" began to take shape in the wide political world, and as Minuo moved from a feudal society to a society of centralization and government, alliances and international co-operation has allowed both the independence and integrity of a multi-national world, and the centralization of blocs of power into large organizations.

As a result, ever since the outcome of the [[The Great Global War|Global War]] and the [[Decade of Revolution]] that followed, the political landscape of Minuo has sinceforth been consolidated into a few major alliances.

## [[International Assembly]]
No list of alliances can be complete without mentioning the International Assembly, a multi-continental international organization that serves as a platform where nations from all corners of Minuo to come together and move forward. Established in the wake of the [[The Great Global War|Global War]], the International Assembly's main objective is to bridge disputes, give a platform to small nations / isolated nations, and foster relations between large entities, small entities, and political movements.

Although once effective and a powerful tool, it has since been hampered, due to the emergence of powerful unifying factions, or "blocs", within the assembly. These factions have since reached a deadlock in passing legislation and getting things down, reducing the effectiveness of the [[International Assembly]].
