They **Autonomous Revolutionary Society of the April 14th Liberation Movement**, (also known as the "Revolutionary Society", or "Liberation State"), is the government and revolutionary state that currently rules what was once the "Republic of Nemza". The "Autonomous Society" was born as a result of a series of coups that was funded by the [[Socialist Empire of Azcordia]], that sought to put the left-leaning political faction, known as "Freedom Fighters" of Nemza in power of the nation (see [[Operation Dondevsky]]). 

However, in the chaos of the first coup, a second coup followed after the popular [[Party of National Workers]] (NWP)'s president was assassinated, and an extreme left-leaning figure within the breakaway party, called the [[Freedom Stars of Liberation]] (FZL) took over the nation. Since then, the Republic of Nemza was disbanded under the new government, and a new "Autonomous Revolutionary Society" was declared in it's place.

The Autonomous Revolutionary Society is most well known in the international stage for their adherence to a very extreme branch of [[societalism]] ideology, known as anarcho-societalism. Although the idea of a "stateless" society is by definition not practical, the Revolutionary Society believes that they are the sole upholders of such an ideology, which calls for equality by the removal of the governmental apparatus. As a result, the entire "Revolutionary Society" is governed by a "Communal Council", who seeks to represent the will of the people, and sees that their demands are met.

## Government

The Autonomous Revolutionary Society is led by the "Communal Council", which acts as a de-facto parliament for the newly formed anarchistic nation. Made to represent the will of the people, the Communal Council aims to make decisions concerning economic, political, and trade, placing a higher focus on lower-strata citizens. Although the Communal Council is full of those qualified to represent the nation, as of currently, it is predominated by the [[Freedom Stars of Liberation| FZL]], [[[Party of National Workers | NWP]], and the former Freedom Fighters party, now rebranded into the [[League of Roses]], or simply the Party of Roses.
