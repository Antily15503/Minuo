They **Autonomous Revolutionary Society of the April 14th Liberation Movement**, (also known as the "Revolutionary Society", or "Liberation State"), is the government and revolutionary state that currently rules what was once the "Republic of Nemza". The "Autonomous Society" was born from a series of coups that was funded by the [[Socialist Empire of Azcordia]], that sought to put the broad "Freedom Fighters" of Nemza in power of the nation. However, a second coup followed after the popular [[Party of National Workers]] (NWP)'s president was assassinated, and an extreme left-leaning figure of the [[Freedom Stars of Liberation]] (FZL) took over the nation. Since then, the Republic of Nemza was disbanded under the new government, and a new "Autonomous Revolutionary Society" was declared in it's place.

The Autonomous Revolutionary Society is most well known in the international stage for their adherence to a very extreme branch of [[societalism]] ideology, known as anarcho-societalism.
