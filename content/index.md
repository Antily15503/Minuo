Welcome to Minuo, a geopolitical atlas of cultures, societies and nations. It aims to model a fictional world that is similar to Earth, with our 206 distinct and unique nations, and all the complex interactions that occurs between them. Although this project is no-way perfect or realistic, it serves as a way for me to explore new ideas, cultures, religions, or ideologies.

I am to make this wiki page as realistic as possible, and maybe discover new thoughts and concepts along the way. After all, that is the best way for thinkers to explore new concepts, either fictional or real!

Join me, as we watch together how the fate of the world dance around the art of relations, schemes, and politics.

This page serves as the Main Hub for the world of Minuo, from which you can navigate to any page you wish!

[[Alliances of the World]]
A list of the main alliances within the world of Minuo. Rival trans-national alliances that seek to dominate weaker members for control, while at the same time exporting their way of life around the world. The Alliance of the World serves to document these global alliances, and narrate the complex interactions that occur among them.
